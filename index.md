# Welcome to my CS 499 ePortfolio!

This ePortfolio is designed to showcase my skills and abilities from the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. It will contain an artifact or artifacts demonstrating my skills and abilities in three key categories:

1. Software design and engineering
2. Algorithms and data structure
3. Databases

## Professional Self-Assessment

Over the past two years, I have grown significantly as a coder while completing my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University. Each course has helped me nurture my skills as a developer, a tester, and a voice on the development team. Although I have never wavered from my goal of using this degree to become a computer science teacher, I have learned a lot of skills that can be applied as an educator as well as a coder. Some of those skills include honing my communication strategies by utilizing a Daily Scrum to communicate with team members about on-going projects or developing collaboration boards to display the current, on-going, and future development of a project for stakeholders. Also, I have learned a significant amount about security in relation to coding as well as general online practices. For example, coding errors are some of the main ways hackers break systems and utilize them for their own means. Also, one of the most preventable vulnerabilities is related to human errors such as poor password security.
However, some skills are particularly important for individuals working in the field of computer science. Those skills are data structures and algorithms, software design and engineering, and database knowledge. I have chosen a few artifacts to demonstrate and display particularly important skills, which are shown below. Those artifacts are as follows: IT 315 Final Project III, CS 260 Hashtables lab, and CS 340 Final Project.
The IT 315 Final Project III focuses on software design and engineering by demonstrating planning during the development of a project. To be more explicit, it contains two diagrams that outline the communication and sequences of a Student Information System that allows students and enrollment staff to enroll a student in courses. Through enhancing this artifact, a greater emphasis has been placed on security by highlighting a system of checks during the enrollment process and establishing a hierarchy in the communication process. Also, it helped identify sections of code that included repeating processes, which could be used to create functions to simplify the code during development.
While the IT 315 Final Project III emphasizes my skills related to the planning process and communication with development teams, the CS 260 Hashtables lab emphasizes using data structures and algorithms to solve problems. Specifically, the lab involved utilizing hashtables (data structures commonly used to store key and value pairs) to display, insert, and remove information. During the enhancement process, code was organized using additional comments, sections of code that were non-function were updated, and vulnerabilities concerning user input were identified and managed.
The final artifact, CS 340 Final Project, incorporates a significant amount of skills. However, it particularly highlights database development and querying. In particular, several code documents can be utilized to complete actions in MongoDB including creating, inserting, and deleting documents as well as querying data and utilizing a RESTful API. During the enhancement process, comments updated to ensure accurate explanations for code, variables were checked for consistency and correspondence to values, and overall coding structure was examined for potential vulnerabilities due to user input.
Each of these artifacts demonstrates a skill that is essential to anyone working in the field of computer science, and they highlight concepts that a computer science educator should be knowledgeable of to support young coders. In addition to the skills mentioned for each artifact, there is also a demonstration of knowledge related to different coding languages (e.g. C, C++, etc) as well as knowledge related to the core planning process, which can be utilized to develop projects in any coding language.
